### Structure

Main idea of this boilerplate is making everything simple and easy to use thats why whole project structure is small and easy to understand but in same time if someone wants to improve it by adding more packages or changing structure then its easy to achive based on this project.

Here is project structure: 
```
app // React Redux file structure
--actions
--components
--containers
--reducers
--index.html
--index.js
dist // React Redux production directory
--app.bundle.js
--index.html
main.js // Main Electron file
```
